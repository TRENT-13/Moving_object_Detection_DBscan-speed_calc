# Object Detection and Tracking System

This code detects moving objects in video and tracks their speed. Here's how it actually works.

## What the Code Does

The system processes video frame by frame to:
1. Find moving objects by comparing with background
2. Draw boundaries around objects using edge detection
3. Group edge points into complete objects
4. Track objects across frames and calculate their speed

## Core Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. Background Subtraction (`remove_background`)

```python
fg_mask = self.bg_subtractor.apply(frame)
```

MOG2 learns what the background looks like over 500 frames. When something moves, it shows up as white pixels in the mask. Static objects (parked cars, buildings) become part of the background and get ignored.

**Why this works**: Moving objects appear different from the learned background, so they get detected as foreground.

### 2. Edge Detection Pipeline

```python
sobelxy = cv2.Sobel(blurred, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 1, ksize=5)
edges = cv2.Canny(cv2.convertScaleAbs(sobelxy), 40, 80)
filtered = cv2.bitwise_and(edges, edges, mask=fg_mask)
```

- **Sobel**: Finds where pixel intensity changes rapidly (edges)
- **Canny**: Cleans up the Sobel output, giving thin edge lines
- **Masking**: Only keeps edges that are also in the foreground mask

**Result**: You get clean edge outlines of only the moving objects, not background edges.

### 3. Edge Interpolation (`interpolate_edges`)

This is the key part you mentioned. When you find contours, they often have gaps:

```python
def interpolate_edges(self, contours, spacing=25):
    points = []
    for i in range(len(contours) - 1):
        pt1 = contours[i]
        pt2 = contours[i + 1]
        points.append(pt1)
        
        dist = np.linalg.norm(np.array(pt1) - np.array(pt2))
        num_points = max(2, int(dist / spacing))
        
        for j in range(1, num_points):
            offset = j / num_points
            point = pt1 + offset * (pt2 - pt1)
            points.append(point.astype(int))
```

**What this does**: 
- Takes two consecutive points on an edge
- If they're far apart (>25 pixels), adds points in between
- Creates a dense, connected edge instead of scattered points

**Why it matters**: DBSCAN clustering needs dense point clusters. Without interpolation, you get sparse points that don't cluster well, so objects get missed or split.

### 4. DBSCAN Clustering

```python
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=30, min_samples=220).fit(points)
```

**What DBSCAN does**:
- Groups points that are close together (within 30 pixels)
- Needs at least 220 points to form a cluster (filters out noise)
- Each cluster becomes one detected object

**Why these numbers**: 
- `eps=30`: Objects bigger than 30 pixels get detected
- `min_samples=220`: Prevents small noise from being detected as objects

### 5. Object Tracking (`ObjectTracker.update`)

```python
for centroid in centroids:
    min_dist = float('inf')
    matching_id = None
    
    for obj_id, obj_data in self.tracked_objects.items():
        dist = np.linalg.norm(np.array(centroid) - np.array(obj_data['positions'][-1]))
        if dist < min_dist and dist < self.max_distance:
            min_dist = dist
            matching_id = obj_id
```

**How tracking works**:
- For each new object found, look at all previously tracked objects
- Find the closest previous object (within 100 pixels)
- If found, it's the same object moved; if not, it's a new object

### 6. Speed Calculation

```python
time_diff = obj_data['timestamps'][-1] - obj_data['timestamps'][-2]
dist = np.linalg.norm(
    np.array(obj_data['positions'][-1]) - 
    np.array(obj_data['positions'][-2])
)
speed = (dist / self.pixels_per_meter) / time_diff
speed_kph = speed * 3.6
```

**The math**:
1. Distance moved = pixel distance between current and previous position
2. Convert pixels to meters using `pixels_per_meter = 17`
3. Speed = distance / time_difference
4. Convert m/s to km/h by multiplying by 3.6

## Key Parameters You Can Tune

**MOG2 Background Subtractor**:
```python
self.bg_subtractor = cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2(history=500, varThreshold=16, detectShadows=False)
```
- `history=500`: Uses 500 frames to learn background
- `varThreshold=16`: Sensitivity (lower = more sensitive)

**DBSCAN Clustering**:
```python
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=30, min_samples=220)
```
- `eps=30`: Points within 30 pixels get grouped
- `min_samples=220`: Need 220+ points to form an object

**Object Tracking**:
```python
self.max_distance = 100
self.pixels_per_meter = 17
```
- `max_distance=100`: Objects can move max 100 pixels between frames
- `pixels_per_meter=17`: Calibration for your specific camera/distance

**Edge Interpolation**:
```python
spacing=25
```
- Adds points every 25 pixels along edges

## Why Each Step Matters

1. **Background subtraction** removes static stuff so you only process moving objects
2. **Edge detection** finds object boundaries instead of just blobs
3. **Interpolation** fills gaps in edges so clustering works properly
4. **DBSCAN** groups edge points into complete objects
5. **Convex hull** creates smooth object boundaries from clustered points
6. **Tracking** maintains object identity across frames
7. **Speed calculation** uses position changes over time

The interpolation step you asked about is crucial because raw contours often have big gaps between points. DBSCAN needs dense point clusters to work, so filling these gaps makes the difference between detecting objects properly or missing them entirely.

## Usage

```python
detector = ObjectDetector()
detector.process_video("your_video.mp4")
```
